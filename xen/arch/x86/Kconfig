config PV
	def_bool y
	prompt "PV support"
	---help---
	  Interfaces to support PV domains. These require guest kernel support
	  to run as a PV guest, but don't require any specific hardware support.

	  This option is needed if you want to run PV domains.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PV_LINEAR_PT
       bool "Support for PV linear pagetables"
       depends on PV
       default y
       ---help---
         Linear pagetables (also called "recursive pagetables") refers
         to the practice of a guest operating system having pagetable
         entries pointing to other pagetables of the same level (i.e.,
         allowing L2 PTEs to point to other L2 pages).  Some operating
         systems use it as a simple way to consistently map the current
         process's pagetables into its own virtual address space.

         Linux and MiniOS don't use this technique.  NetBSD and Novell
         Netware do; there may be other custom operating systems which
         do.  If you're certain you don't plan on having PV guests
         which use this feature, turning it off can reduce the attack
         surface.

         If unsure, say Y.

config HVM
	def_bool !PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE
	prompt "HVM support"
	---help---
	  Interfaces to support HVM domains.  HVM domains require hardware
	  virtualisation extensions (e.g. Intel VT-x, AMD SVM), but can boot
	  guests which have no specific Xen knowledge.

	  This option is needed if you want to run HVM or PVH domains.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SHADOW_PAGING
        bool "Shadow Paging"
        default y
        ---help---

          Shadow paging is a software alternative to hardware paging support
          (Intel EPT, AMD NPT).

          It is required for:
            * Running HVM guests on hardware lacking hardware paging support
              (First-generation Intel VT-x or AMD SVM).
            * Live migration of PV guests.
            * L1TF sidechannel mitigation for PV guests.

          Under a small number of specific workloads, shadow paging may be
          deliberately used as a performance optimisation.

          If unsure, say Y.

config BIGMEM
	bool "big memory support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Allows Xen to support up to 123Tb of memory.

	  This requires enlarging struct page_info as well as shrinking
	  the always accessible direct mapped memory range.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HVM_FEP
	bool "HVM Forced Emulation Prefix support" if EXPERT = "y"
	default DEBUG
	depends on HVM
	---help---

	  Compiles in a feature that allows HVM guest to arbitrarily
	  exercise the instruction emulator.

	  This feature can only be enabled during boot time with
	  appropriate hypervisor command line option. Please read
	  hypervisor command line documentation before trying to use
	  this feature.

	  This is strictly for testing purposes, and not appropriate
	  for use in production.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BOOT_DOMAIN
	bool "Boot Domain support" if EXPERT = "y"
	default y
	depends on HVM
	---help---
	  Enables launch of multiple VMs at host boot as an alternative
	  method of starting a Xen system. Does not require a dom0.

	  This feature is currently experimental.

	  If unsure, say N.

config TBOOT
	def_bool y
	prompt "Xen tboot support" if EXPERT = "y"
	select CRYPTO
	---help---
	  Allows support for Trusted Boot using the Intel(R) Trusted Execution
	  Technology (TXT)

	  If unsure, say Y.

choice
	prompt "Alignment of Xen image"
	default XEN_ALIGN_2M if PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE
	default XEN_ALIGN_DEFAULT
	---help---
	  Specify alignment for Xen image.

	  If unsure, choose "default".

config XEN_ALIGN_DEFAULT
	bool "Default alignment"
	---help---
	  Pick alignment according to build variants.

	  For EFI build the default alignment is 2M. For ELF build
	  the default alignment is 4K due to syslinux failing to handle
	  the increment of image size induced by 2M alignment.

	  Support booting using the PVH ABI.

config PV_SHIM
	def_bool y
	prompt "PV Shim"
	depends on PV && XEN_GUEST
	---help---
	  Build Xen with a mode which acts as a shim to allow PV guest to run
	  in an HVM/PVH container. This mode can only be enabled with command
	  line option.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PV_SHIM_EXCLUSIVE
	bool "PV Shim Exclusive"
	depends on PV_SHIM
	---help---
	  Build Xen in a way which unconditionally assumes PV_SHIM mode.  This
	  option is only intended for use when building a dedicated PV Shim
	  firmware, and will not function correctly in other scenarios.

	  If unsure, say N.
