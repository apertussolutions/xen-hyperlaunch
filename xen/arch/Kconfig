	  Controls the build-time size of various arrays and bitmaps
	  associated with multiple-cpu management.  It is the upper bound of
	  the number of logical entities the scheduler can run code on.

	  For CPU cores which support Simultaneous Multi-Threading or similar
	  technologies, this the number of logical threads which Xen will
	  support.

	help
	  Controls the build-time size of various arrays allocated for
	  parsing the boot modules passed by a loader when starting Xen.

	  This is of particular interest when using Xen's hypervisor domain
	  capabilities such as dom0less.
